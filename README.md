Telltale is an open-source Flutter app for real-time vehicle telemetry and OBD2
fault diagnosis through an ELM327-compatible adapter. It is designed to expose
uncertainty instead of turning malformed, incomplete, or conflicting replies
into confident-looking results.

> **A plausible wrong number is worse than no number.**

> **No car or adapter? Use Demo ECU.**
>
> On the connect screen open **Demo simulator** → **Start the simulator**. You get live dashboards, fault codes, and freeze frames with no hardware. Demo never touches Bluetooth, sockets, or a vehicle — it proves the app path, not that a real car will connect.

The screenshots above are upstream's. This fork's own screenshots, taken on a
phone against Demo ECU and showing the Simplified Chinese interface, live in
[`store/zh-CN/`](store/zh-CN) and are shown in
[README.zh-CN.md](README.zh-CN.md).
It shows one real Samsung, adapter, and vehicle combination. The vehicle VIN is
redacted; the demo is evidence for that observed setup, not a universal
compatibility claim.

## Download and install

**This fork is not on Google Play.** Build it from source — see
[Build and test](#build-and-test) — or take the APK attached to this
repository's Releases. Everything below describes **upstream's** builds.

**Preferred:** **[Get the Play-signed build from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cbstudio.telltale).**

**Paid on Google Play, with the same app features.** The Play edition does not
unlock extra telemetry or diagnostic features. It is the convenient choice for
Play-managed installation and updates, and purchasing it supports ongoing
development and maintenance. The community-signed APK below and builds from
source remain free to use.

**Community-signed APK** (same features as Play; release binaries are not stored
in the source tree):

1. **[GitHub aa22396584 v1.0.14](https://github.com/aa22396584/telltale/releases/tag/v1.0.14)**
2. **[Codeberg v1.0.14](https://codeberg.org/ImL1s/telltale/releases/tag/v1.0.14)**
3. **[GitLab Releases](https://gitlab.com/aa22396584/telltale/-/releases)**

Open the release and select its `.apk` asset. [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium)
can track updates from `https://github.com/aa22396584/telltale/releases` or
`https://codeberg.org/ImL1s/telltale/releases`.

Community APKs use a **different signing key** from Google Play. They cannot
update, or be updated by, the Play build. Switching between them requires
uninstalling Telltale; export anything you need first because uninstalling
removes local app data.

## What it supports

- Bluetooth Classic using RFCOMM/SPP
- Bluetooth LE using a GATT UART service
- Wi-Fi adapters using a local TCP connection
- A built-in Demo ECU that needs no adapter or vehicle
- Live PID dashboards, fault codes, freeze frames, readiness, custom PIDs, and
  user-triggered diagnostic transcript export
- A searchable, integrity-checked schema-v3 powertrain-battery catalog with
  221 source-backed PHEV, HEV, BEV, MHEV, REEV, and FCEV profiles: 205
  metadata-only `researchOnly` entries, twelve installable cross-corroborated
  `community` entries (MG ZS EV Mk1, MG4 Electric, MG5 EV, BYD Atto 3,
  Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6, Kia EV6,
  Hyundai Kona Electric, Kia Niro EV, Kia Soul EV, Renault Zoe Ph1, VW e-up!
  gen2 — read-only BMS gauges, confirmed by at least two independent
  implementations, gated behind an install-time identity acknowledgement and
  a fresh per-connection vehicle confirmation), and four opt-in
  `experimental` entries (Lexus RX450hL, Toyota Prius TNGA, Kia EV9,
  Toyota bZ4X / Subaru Solterra e-TNGA). Three Mode 22 maps (Prius, EV9,
  e-TNGA) may be installed, labelled Experimental · Unverified on this
  vehicle; the Lexus Mode 21 map stays in the one-shot laboratory. The
  executable subset totals 157 bounded read-only signals; the powertrain
  split is BEV 89, FCEV 5, HEV 48, MHEV 7, PHEV 69, and REEV 3
- An integrity-checked, fully offline U.S. EPA Find-a-Car snapshot with 50,242
  exact configurations across 146 make labels and model years 1984–2027. Only
  source fields whose meaning matches the physics profile are applied; the app
  does not infer mass, torque, drag, VE, or transmission efficiency
- A fail-closed flow shared by every configured vehicle profile: any raw PID
  the vehicle answers remains visible, but profile-derived horsepower, torque,
  and fuel estimates stay hidden until the driver reviews and confirms the
  inputs for that connection; reconnecting invalidates the confirmation

The experimental battery laboratory is off by default. Its persistent Settings
switch only reveals the laboratory; it never trusts a vehicle. For every
connection and every attempt, the driver must choose one pinned Mode 21 or 22
command and give a new, short-lived acknowledgement for the selected year,
known identity evidence, unresolved fields, and a safely parked vehicle. The
app sends that command once: no identifier scan, batch, automatic retry,
installation, scheduled polling, persisted telemetry value, or dashboard use.
It accepts only the pinned responder, positive-response echo, exact payload
length, finite formula result, and bounded range.

The one-use consent is bound to the verified catalog hash, source revision,
profile, command, year, and connection generation. It expires after two
minutes; a five-second cooldown, three-attempt-per-command connection limit,
single-flight gate, structural-mismatch quarantine, and lifecycle/link boundary
invalidation keep it fail closed. The normal diagnostic transcript still
records the command and response as evidence; a synthetic rig or phone transport
test does not prove that a real vehicle exposes or correctly decodes that PID.
See [powertrain battery profiles](docs/powertrain-battery-profiles.md) for the
full counts, source limits, consent rules, licence, and validation boundary.

Android is the primary physically tested platform for device, UI, and BLE-rig
paths. iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux have public compile gates and a runnable
Demo / Wi-Fi path in-tree; BLE is wired on every shipping host (Linux via
BlueZ/D-Bus). They do not yet carry equivalent physical-adapter or vehicle
evidence. Bluetooth Classic is offered in the UI on Android, macOS, Windows,
and Linux (`classicTransportAvailable`): Android is field-proven RFCOMM/SPP;
macOS uses IOBluetooth RFCOMM; Windows and Linux open Bluetooth SPP COM /
`/dev/rfcomm*` serial nodes. iOS permanently blocks third-party SPP and keeps
the Classic card grey. Desktop Classic is wired but still needs powered-adapter
field evidence before calling it mature. See
[platform support](docs/platform-support.md).

## Field-tested adapter

The maintainer has used Telltale over Bluetooth LE with a
**CARLZS LAB CL-OBDII-M25B** (`OBDBLE`, NCC `CCAH22LP5300T8`) on a Toyota
GT86. The same Samsung `SM-S9280` still holds a 418,028-byte recovered Telltale
session dated 2026-08-27.

**[View this adapter on Shopee](https://s.shopee.tw/3LQPiOY7uv)** — this is a
maintainer affiliate link. A qualifying purchase may pay the maintainer a
commission; you are free to search for or buy the same model elsewhere.
The same listing is in the app: Settings shows the full disclosure card;
Connect keeps a secondary text link below the transports.

This is one observed adapter/phone/vehicle combination, not certification or
a promise that every listing variant, phone, vehicle, PID, or firmware behaves
the same. Check the exact model and NCC number before buying. See the
[hardware compatibility notes](docs/hardware-compatibility.md) for the evidence
boundary.

## Build and test

Use the pinned Flutter 3.47.0 toolchain:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aa22396584/telltale.git
cd telltale
FLUTTER="$HOME/fvm/versions/3.47.0/bin/flutter"
"$FLUTTER" pub get
"$FLUTTER" analyze
"$FLUTTER" test
"$FLUTTER" build apk --debug --flavor field
```

For a self-signed release build, follow
[the maintainer release guide](docs/maintainers/release.md). The `field` flavor
is the real-use application; the isolated `rig` flavor is test infrastructure.

## Verification boundary

The real Samsung-to-Mac BLE GATT radio path has passed with a simulated ELM327
peripheral. This proves physical BLE discovery, GATT connection, UART writes,
and notifications on that path. Separately, the field observation above proves
that one purchased CL-OBDII-M25B setup connected Telltale to one Toyota GT86
and left a substantial session record. The raw vehicle transcript is not
published because it can contain VIN and device identifiers; it was analysed
locally and only de-identified protocol shapes became regression fixtures. The
retained idle polling used CAN 11-bit/500 kbit/s and showed no `NO DATA`,
CAN/BUS error, timeout, or malformed reply. A large capacity-evicted middle
range remains, so the observation does **not** certify adapter firmware, PID
accuracy, DTC coverage, loaded-road behaviour, or general GT86 support.

Verification reports describe bounded evidence, not certification or a safety
guarantee. Start with [test evidence](docs/verification/test-evidence.md) and
[device verification](docs/verification/device-verification.md), then use the
[verification rig matrix](docs/verification/rig-matrix.md) for the reproducible
and identified commercial test layers.

## Privacy and safe use

Telltale proactively uploads nothing. Local diagnostic exports can contain VIN,
device, adapter, and fault identifiers. You control explicit export and sharing;
operating-system backup may also copy private app data according to device
settings. Read [the repository policy](PRIVACY.md) or the
[published privacy policy](https://aa22396584.github.io/telltale/privacy.html#en).

Use the app only while parked or as a passenger. Save diagnostic evidence before
clearing DTCs, and do not treat this app as a substitute for professional
inspection. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for private vulnerability reporting
and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for community expectations.

## Changes in this fork

Upstream's app, with a Simplified Chinese interface added. Nothing else is
intended to differ, and the change is small enough to review in one sitting:

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `lib/l10n/app_zh_Hans.arb` | New locale: 1220 messages, translated from `app_en.arb` |
| `lib/l10n/pid_labels.dart` | New: maps a built-in PID to its shipped name |
| `lib/obd/pid/pid.dart`, `pid_library.dart` | `Pid.l10nId`, set on the 25 built-in PIDs; `name`/`shortName` keep serving custom and catalog definitions verbatim |
| `lib/ui/screens/pids/pid_manager_screen.dart`, `lib/ui/screens/dashboard/dashboard_screen.dart`, `lib/ui/screens/dtc/dtc_screen.dart`, `lib/ui/wear/wear_shell.dart`, `lib/ui/widgets/telemetry/telemetry_lane_selector.dart` | Draw the shipped PID name instead of the author's English one |
| `lib/l10n/locale_resolution.dart`, `app_locales_sync.dart`, `lib/ui/widgets/language_picker.dart` | Offer 简体中文; map `zh-Hans`, `zh-CN`, `zh-SG` and follow-system devices onto it |
| `android/app/src/main/kotlin/.../AppLocalePolicy.kt`, `android/app/src/main/res/xml/locales_config.xml`, `ios/Runner/Info.plist`, `macos/Runner/Info.plist` | Register `zh-Hans` with the OS, without which Android 13+ rejects an in-app switch to it as an unknown tag |
| `tool/i18n/apply_translation.py`, `tool/build_apk.sh` | CSV → ARB importer with the repo's own checks, and a release build that sets `allowUnsignedRelease` |

Files untouched by this fork are upstream's, and the tests that pin upstream
copy still pin it. `test/l10n/` passes except upstream's `glossary_evidence_test`,
whose citations into `README.md` and `app_en.arb` are stale in this snapshot.

## Licence and disclaimer

Contributions are welcome under the [contributor guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
Telltale is licensed under [GPL-3.0](LICENSE), and so is this fork: the modified
files are the ones listed above, and the licence and the upstream copyright
notices are unchanged. It is not affiliated with Ian
Hawkins' Torque or Torque Pro and is neither an official nor derivative version
of either product. The bundled official vehicle-data snapshots keep their own
[source and reuse notices](assets/vehicle_catalog/NOTICE.md). Powertrain-battery
sources retain separate
[third-party notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES_POWERTRAIN_BATTERY.md). Use the app at
your own risk; no diagnostic result guarantees that a vehicle is safe to
operate.
