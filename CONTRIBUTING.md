# Contributing

The short version: run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test`, walk the screens
you touched on a device or an emulator, and say in the pull request what you
checked and what you did not. The rest of this file is the reasoning, and the
two or three things about this project that are not obvious.

## Where this repository sits

This repository is a **mirror** of a private source that also holds a
reverse-engineered protocol specification, which is why that source cannot be
opened. From 2026-09-09, **product pull requests, required CI, and issues land
here**. Do not open a matching private PR and do not consume the private
repository's GitHub Actions; public `main` push CI is the merge gate. Spec and
reference-implementation work stay private. A later maintainer sync still
copies `lib/`, `test/`, `android/`, `ios/` and `macos/` back to the private
`app/` tree — that sync is not a second product source, and it is not a reason
to burn private Actions on every leftover.

A small publish-only set lives here and is maintained on the public side:
`.github/`, `store/`, and the GitHub Pages shell files `docs/.nojekyll`,
`docs/index.html`, and `docs/privacy.html`. Product Markdown documentation and
`PRIVACY.md` come from the private source of truth. CI differs between the two
sides because the private repository also runs the reference implementations
and an oracle whose simulator cannot be published.

That has one consequence for you: a merged pull request is applied by hand on
the private side and arrives back here in the next sync, so the commit that
lands may not carry your SHA. Authorship is preserved in the commit message.
It is not ideal and it is honest.

Issues and pull requests here are read and answered.

## Toolchain

Flutter **3.47.0** / Dart **3.13.0**. Other versions may work; this is the one
that CI runs and the one release builds are made with.

```bash
flutter --version        # expect 3.47.0
flutter pub get
flutter analyze          # expect: No issues found!
flutter test
flutter build apk --debug --flavor field
```

`flutter analyze` clean is not advisory. The repository has no accepted
warnings, so one new warning is visible; that only stays true while the count
is zero.

## The tests that skip, and why the number matters

`flutter test` reports **16 skipped** without a simulator on Linux, macOS,
and Windows hosts that have Git-for-Windows or a usable WSL. That is not
slack — it is 15 discovered oracle cases (emulator 6, freeze-frame 7,
chaos 1, chaos-poll 1) plus one battery TCP rig skip. Those files skip unless
their required emulator, fault proxy, or loopback peer is running and
explicitly enabled:

| suite | tests | simulator |
|---|---|---|
| `test/emulator_integration_test.dart` | 6 | [Ircama/ELM327-emulator](https://github.com/Ircama/ELM327-emulator) |
| `test/freeze_frame_oracle_test.dart` | 7 | project-owned `tool/obd_test_rig/freeze_frame_reference.py` |
| `test/chaos_oracle_test.dart` | 1 | Ircama through `tool/obd_test_rig/chaos_proxy.py` |
| `test/chaos_poll_oracle_test.dart` | 1 | armed close after the first live poll |
| `test/powertrain_battery_tcp_integration_test.dart` | 1 | `tool/powertrain_battery_rig/simulator.py` |

Case counts are produced by `tool/workshop/count_dart_tests.py` from the files
themselves. Public CI feeds that number to `tool/oracle_guard/assert_no_skips.py`.
Do not type a replacement integer into the workflow to make a skip look green.

**A skipped test and a passing test print the same summary and both exit 0.**
That is why the number is worth knowing: **16** is the expected default when
a POSIX shell is available (always on Linux/macOS CI) and **10** means Ircama
alone is running; other counts deserve inspection. A Windows host with
neither Git-for-Windows nor a usable WSL additionally skips the release-notes
contract (`test/release_notes_contract_test.dart`) and the POSIX-shell
helpers that need bash; that extra skip is false on Linux/macOS, so
`count_dart_tests.py` and `assert_no_skips.py` keep counting the same cases.
CI does not rely on reading the number — it parses each oracle's JSON report,
keeps the Flutter process exit code, and fails the job if a test was skipped
rather than run. The chaos job also verifies the exact commands that reached
the proxy before each injected fault.

To run the first suite yourself:

```bash
python3 -m venv /tmp/elmvenv
# Two steps, not one. ELM327-emulator ships as an sdist whose build backend
# imports pkg_resources, which setuptools 82 removed, so a plain
# `pip install ELM327-emulator` fails with `No module named 'pkg_resources'`.
# Measured 2026-08-20: 80.10.2 has it, 81.0.0 still has it, 82.0.0 does not.
# It can also appear to work on a machine that already has the wheel cached —
# same day: succeeds from cache, fails under --no-cache-dir.

  --no-build-isolation ELM327-emulator==3.0.5
/tmp/elmvenv/bin/pip check

# The fail-fast subshell cleans up immediately after the test, not when your
# terminal exits. The wrapper rejects a missing/shared PID directory, binds

    fi
    if [ -n "$ELM_PID" ]; then
      wait "$ELM_PID" 2>/dev/null || true
    fi
    rm -rf -- "${ELM_PID_DIR:?}"
    exit "$rc"
  }
  trap cleanup_elm EXIT

  /tmp/elmvenv/bin/python tool/ble_test_rig/emulator_entrypoint.py \

  flutter test test/emulator_integration_test.dart \
    --dart-define=ELM_ORACLE_REQUIRED=true
)
BASH
```

The `ELM_ORACLE_REQUIRED` define turns a missing or unrecognised listener into
a test failure. Do not omit it when claiming oracle evidence; the default full
suite intentionally marks an unavailable external oracle as skipped.

Both suites listen on port 35000 and tell each other apart by the answer to
`AT@1`, so only one can run at a time.

The freeze-frame suite talks to `tool/obd_test_rig/freeze_frame_reference.py`.
That process is project-owned (AT@1 is `Telltale Freeze-Frame Reference`); it is
not a third-party oracle and must not be described as one. Ircama remains the
independent third-party check. Run both through
`tool/workshop/run_public_oracles.sh` from a clean checkout — no private token
is required. `--dart-define=FREEZE_FRAME_ORACLE_REQUIRED=true` turns a missing
listener into a failure.

`tool/obd_test_rig/README.md` documents the no-fault fragmentation pass and the
three fresh-process fault runs (`close`, `no_prompt`, and `corrupt`). These use
the real `WifiTransport` socket and fail closed during initialization.

### Bluetooth LE, without an adapter

`tool/ble_test_rig/` advertises a real Nordic UART peripheral from a Mac and
puts the same third-party ELM327 emulator behind it, so a phone running the app
can be taken through a real GATT connect, discovery, subscribe and notification
stream with no hardware and no car. Its README explains the two macOS traps
that make it look broken when it is not — and the one that makes it look
working when it is not: a Mac cannot see its own peripheral, so scanning from
the same machine finds nothing and proves nothing.

The Android driver uses the isolated `com.cbstudio.telltale.rig` debug package,
marks stored evidence as simulated, and cannot approve a system permission
dialog. Follow the README's preinstall and `adb shell pm grant` steps on a fresh
phone. A passing run requires exactly one subscribed BLE central.

**Why two, and why third-party at all.** Every other test in this suite is
ultimately this project's parser checked against this project's simulator —
both sides carrying the same reading of J1979, so a misreading agrees with
itself. The oracles are implementations written by other people from the same
standard. Within an hour of being connected, the first one found two real
defects.

## The rules a change is held to

These are not style preferences. Nearly every one is here because its absence
produced a bug that survived a green test suite.

- **A plausible wrong number is worse than no number.** This is the organising
  principle. When an input is missing or a response cannot be attributed, the
  app shows nothing and says why. It does not interpolate, and it does not
  round a guess into something that looks like a measurement.
- **Responses are parsed against a whitelist, never a blacklist.**
  `Elm327Client._parse` accepts only lines that are entirely hex byte pairs.
  Stripping non-hex characters and concatenating what is left turns `DATA
  ERROR` into two bytes read as a sensor value, and shifts a multi-frame
  payload by half a byte because of its length line. Both produce numbers that
  look reasonable.
- **The demo simulator must be at least as harsh as real hardware.** It emits
  the command echo that precedes `ATE0`, `SEARCHING...`, and multi-frame
  responses with length lines and zero padding. It was once more forgiving than
  a real ELM327, and three critical defects lived under 71 green tests because
  of it. Add the realistic framing first, then the test that catches it.
- **The freeze frame is gated on its cause code.** A controller with no stored
  frame does not refuse the request — it answers `00 00` for the cause code and
  then answers every other PID with zeros, which decode to 0 rpm and −40 °C
  under a heading that says "at the moment the fault occurred". Somebody fixes
  a car from that. `DtcDecoder.decodePair` returns null for `0x0000` and the
  gate is built on that existing rule; do not add a second one.
- **Gauge colours come from `context.gaugeColors(hue)`**, never from the light
  or dark palette directly. The two palettes are separately designed rather
  than inversions of each other — dark runs deep to vivid, light runs pastel to
  saturated mid-tone — and mixing them muddies the light dials.
- **The adapter's self-report is a claim, not a fact.** Clones report v1.5 and
  behave like v1.3. State is committed only when the adapter literally answers
  `OK`.
- **A check that cannot fail is not a check.** Every guard is proved by
  mutation: break the thing it guards, run it, watch it go red, restore. Not by
  reading it. Guards in this repository have been silent no-ops for a `continue`
  on an unparseable construct, an anchor that never matched the real source, a
  one-character value compared against a two-character string so no escape was
  ever honoured, a test compared against a copy of the code that produced it,
  and a wait whose condition was satisfied by "nothing exists". Every one of
  them was green.
- **A test that measures shape does not measure content.** Uniqueness,
  non-emptiness, presence in both languages and absence of Chinese are all
  invariant under swapping two arms of a switch. Three parallel branches shipped
  exactly those four assertions in one week, and in each the transposition
  passed the entire suite: an adapter yanked mid-command read *"Nothing is
  connected, so the command was not sent"*; a fuel estimate wrote
  `馬力缺少必要輸入` into the evidence export; a refused Location permission told
  the user to turn on Bluetooth. If you add an identifier→sentence table, add a
  **hand-typed** expectation table beside it — you type the expected string, it
  is not read back from the ARB, from `AppLocalizations`, or from the function
  under test — and prove it by transposing two arms and watching it fail.
- **An identifier migration has five links, and pinning one moves the hole.**

  ```
  condition → identifier → sentence → the values in the sentence → the render site
  ```

  Each needs its own mutation. Reviews of the same branch broke it at a
  different link three rounds running: the copy table was pinned, so corrupting
  the carried values stayed green (*"the formula refers to byte Z, but the reply
  carried only 0 bytes"*); those were pinned, so collapsing five refusal
  conditions onto one identifier stayed green; that was pinned, so collapsing
  the two render sites stayed green, because no test in the repository ever
  rendered a refusal through a widget. The chain is only as pinned as its
  loosest link, and the loosest one is usually the one nearest the reader.
- **A comment that names a guard must name one that exists.** A pointer to a
  test file that was renamed is how the next person comes to believe a guard is
  there. Comments claiming a reachability property the code contradicts are the
  same defect: one branch's header said a screen's permission refusal "is always
  the Bluetooth one" while line 555 of that same file asked for location.

- **A check that says more than it checks is worse than no check.** The gap is
  invisible to the suite, because the victim is a reader rather than a
  compiler. This one rule was broken three times in one afternoon, each time by
  a sentence one notch stronger than the thing underneath it:

  | The prose said | The check actually did |
  |---|---|
  | *this exact binary has been walked on a phone* | nothing — the flag was `case $TAG in *-*)` |
  | *a release build of **this commit** was walked* | matched a **version**, which does not move when the code does |
  | *no walk of this version is recorded* | returned before reading the file at all |

  None of the three could fail. The first was found by a reviewer, the second
  by a second reviewer after the first fix shipped, the third by the same
  reviewer in the same pass. Write the sentence *after* the check, from the
  check, and name what it does not cover — a reader can weigh a stated gap and
  cannot weigh a false claim.

- **An attestation is a field, not a sentence.** A gate that reads prose reads
  mentions as claims. `## 2026-09-07 — 1.0.11 walk; 1.0.12 not installed`
  cleared a full release of 1.0.12 against a gate that searched dated headings
  for the version; so did `x1.0.12oops` and `1.0.12-rc.1 planned, no walk`. The
  first of those states the opposite of what it was read as stating, and nobody
  has to be dishonest to write any of them. What a machine reads must be a line
  that takes a deliberate keystroke and cannot occur inside a sentence meaning
  something else — `Device walk attested: 1.0.12`, anchored at both ends.

- **A gate that a person can only clear alone must be clearable alone.** The
  rule before this one required a second adapter and another vehicle. There is
  no number of cars that is "enough", so it never cleared, so every release was
  a pre-release and GitHub's Latest badge sat on a build from nine days earlier
  while the same commit was on Play production at 100%. The boundary did not
  disappear; it moved into the release notes, printed on every build, where it
  is a thing to **state** rather than a thing to **block** on. A gate a
  maintainer cannot pass is not a standard, it is a stall.

- **`cmd | grep -q` under `pipefail` is a size-dependent false refusal.**
  `grep -q` exits on its first match, the upstream process takes SIGPIPE, and
  `pipefail` reports the pipeline as failed — so a line that IS present is read
  as absent. Whether it bites depends on whether the output fits the pipe
  buffer, so it passes on today's file and fails on a later one with no code
  change to blame. Read into a variable, or grep the file directly.

- **A mutation that reports no failure has two explanations, and the second is
  more likely.** Either the test is weak, or the mutation never applied. A
  swap of two table rows in a shell heredoc reported green here because shell
  quoting ate the escaped backticks and the file was never edited. Assert the
  anchor exists before replacing it, and diff the file afterwards.
- **A mutation that does report failure has two explanations as well, and a
  count is the first thing that separates them, not the last.** Four rounds
  here printed `Some tests failed` and named a failing test while
  `flutter test` had loaded nothing at all: three paths went in as one quoted
  argument, so the sole failure was the runner not finding a file — and the
  line naming it is shaped exactly like a real one. Take the test total from
  an unmutated control run first, and void any round whose pass + fail does
  not equal it. A matching total is necessary and not sufficient: an unrelated
  setup or runtime failure can keep the total intact, so also check that the
  test that went red is the one naming what you broke.

  Take that control over the handful of files the change is about, not the
  whole suite. A whole-suite count is not a property of the change: it is the
  red the change caused plus the red the base already carried, and the second
  term moves when the base does. The same sentence in the same commit message
  here was true on the tree it was measured on and false after a rebase, and a
  reader cannot tell from the number which term moved. A scoped total is a
  property of those files.

  (A reviewer also saw one mutant produce 4 red, then 9, then 9 across three
  whole-suite runs in one worktree, and replaying the sequence did not
  reproduce the 4. That is recorded because it happened, not as a reason —
  an unexplained observation is not evidence for a rule, and treating it as
  one is the same move this section exists to stop.)

  Keep the restore out of the round's own control flow, too: that same script
  aborted under `set -u` one line before restoring, because bash reads the
  full-width `）` in `"$BASE）"` as part of the variable name. The mutant
  stayed on disk, and the next round's `cp` then saved *it* as the backup. A
  backup a later round can overwrite is not a backup — take one read-only copy
  and restore from it in a `trap`.
- **Two blind checkers do not compose into one that sees.** When a check is
  deliberately kept simple — a `grep` rather than a parser, because the parser
  would run somewhere it must not fail — the guards written to cover what it
  cannot see must not be simple in the *same* way. Three of them here shared
  one line-anchored regex, so a fenced worked example in the documentation
  satisfied all three at once:

  | the check | why the example satisfied it |
  |---|---|
  | the release gate | `^Device walk attested: 1.0.13$` matched |
  | one version, one attestation | there was exactly one, inside the fence |
  | every attestation belongs to a dated entry | the example brought its **own** heading |

  The third is the sharp one: the corroborating heading was meant to be
  evidence that a person wrote an entry, and inside a fence it is evidence that
  the example is complete. A release of a version nobody had walked would have
  published, green.

  Two consequences worth keeping. Put the parsing where it only has to be right
  about a committed file, not where it runs during a release. And prefer an
  assertion that two readings **agree** — what the machine sees versus what a
  person sees — over one that enumerates the concealment shapes you happened to
  think of.

`docs/protocol-deviations.zh-TW.md` records where this app deliberately departs from the
specification it was derived from, and why. Three of those departures fix
commands that would break a connection to a real vehicle — one of them
silently, and only on vehicles that are not 11-bit CAN. Read it before changing
anything in the AT initialisation sequence.

## Before you open a pull request

- `flutter analyze` — no issues.
- `flutter test` — green, with the skip count where you expect it.
- If you touched anything under `lib/obd/`, run the Ircama oracle above.
- If you touched socket framing, timeouts, or initialization, also run the TCP
  chaos oracle described in `tool/obd_test_rig/README.md`.
- If you touched BLE transport code, run the bridge/probe unit tests; report the
  physical-phone GATT integration separately if no second device was available.
- If you touched anything with a screen, walk that screen. The built-in **Demo
  simulator** on the connect screen runs every screen with no hardware and no
  car; there is no excuse for an unwalked UI change.
- Say what you verified and what you did not. "Not tested against real
  hardware" is a normal and useful sentence — most contributors will not have
  an adapter, and the maintainer does. An unstated gap is the problem, not the
  gap.

## What will be turned down

- Loosening the response parser to accept more shapes.
- Replacing a throwing check with a bare `assert`. `dart run file.dart` disables
  assertions, and three reference implementations once printed their success
  banner with deliberately broken expectations because of it.
- Making the demo simulator more forgiving so a test passes.
- A test that is skipped, or a timing constant enlarged, in place of the
  underlying fix.
- Anything that shows a computed figure when an input it depends on was not
  measured.
