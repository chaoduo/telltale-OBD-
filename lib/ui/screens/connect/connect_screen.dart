  // that this screen cannot localize it.
  //
  // This screen calls `_ensurePermissions` from two places and they are not
  // alike. `_loadPairedDevices` below passes `forScanning: false`: on Android
  // 12 and above the only thing that path can have refused is
  // `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`, and on 11 and below it asks for nothing at all, so
  // the two `connectBluetoothPermission…` messages naming Bluetooth outright
  // are correct on every release. The BLE tab is the other caller — `_BleBody`
  // is built with `ensurePermissions: () => _ensurePermissions(forScanning:
  // true)` — and there the kind is not fixed: on Android 11 and below
  // `ensureBluetoothPermissions` requests `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` and returns
  // `BlePermissionKind.location`.
  //
  // On that path the copy is wrong, and this comment says so rather than
  // phrasing the screen as if the path did not exist. `_BleBody._startScan`
  // shows `connectBlePermissionNeeded` / `connectBlePermissionDeniedForever`;
  // both name Bluetooth, and the second sends the reader into app settings to
  // find a Bluetooth switch that Android 11 and below does not offer, when
  // what they refused was Location. `minSdk` is 24 and AndroidManifest.xml
  // keeps `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` at `maxSdkVersion="30"`, so the branch ships.
  //
  // That is a separate defect and it is not fixed here: this screen behaves
  // exactly as it did before `deniedKind` became an enum, because neither
  // version read it. A fix threads the kind out of `_ensurePermissions` into
  // `_BleBody` and picks the sentence from it — the wear shell already does
  // that through `blePermissionName`, so the copy exists. Until then, what
