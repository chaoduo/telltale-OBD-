    // `double.tryParse` accepts `NaN` and `Infinity`, and every comparison
    // against NaN is false — so `max <= min` waved them straight through. What
    // reaches the screen is not a broken gauge but a confident one: the dial's
    // `((value - min) / (max - min)).clamp(0, 1)` evaluates to **1.0** for NaN
    // in Dart, so the needle sits at full scale and the arc lights completely,
    // for a vehicle at idle.
    //
    // The second consequence is worse for being invisible. `jsonEncode`
    // throws `JsonUnsupportedObjectError` on a non-finite double, so saving
    // wedges *and leaves the definition in memory* — after which every later
    // save of any custom PID throws too, until that one entry is removed.
    //
    // A spreadsheet exports `NaN` on its own; nobody has to be malicious.
