//
// `app_zh.arb` is a byte-for-byte fallback for a plain `zh` device locale that
// carries no script subtag. It is not a second translation and must never
// become one: two Chinese files free to drift are two sources of truth.
//
// German is a machine translation corrected by hand (docs/i18n/README.md). That
// changes what a reviewer can promise about its sentences; it changes nothing
// about what this file checks, because keys, arguments and empty values are
// exactly the failures a translator — human or machine — cannot see and the app
